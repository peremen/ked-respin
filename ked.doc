  Ked is written with C++(GNU). If you have no C++ compiler,
  install it previously.

  If you have any problem with installing, inform me.

  Here are some information about ked.

  * Screen font
    
    Ked loads screen font from directory `/usr/local/fonts'
    Font file's name is `hangul.sft'. If ked does not find it,
    ked try to load `hangul.sft' from current directory.

    So, if you can, place `hangul.sft' to `/usr/local/fonts'.
    If not, you might change directory name in source `Kfont.h'.
    And recomile ked.

  * Printing

    You can print file like this:

    1. Select `print' from menu.
    2. Then in current directory, file named `PrintOut' is created.
    3. Download Korean font.

       % cat Header Munjo | lpr

    4. Print `PrintOut'

       % lpr PrintOut

  * English <--> Korean switching : Ctrl-K or F2
